2.04
  - Fixed bug (Ticket 33542)
    Query parameters should be handled ok now.
    Thanks to 'gnudist' once again!

2.03
  - Fixed bug (Ticket 33495)
    FTP links aren't breaking anything now.
  - Fixed bug (Ticket 33496)
    URLs may take up to 2000 characters now, instead of the previous limit 
    of 500. "2000 should be enough for everybody" ;-)
    Thanks to 'gnudist' for reporting!

2.02
  - Fixed bug (Ticket 31927)
    URIs in the HREF attribute of an A element are now encoded where needed
    unless and encoding entity is already found (%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}), for which
    we then assume the URI is already encoded (like you should!)
    Thanks to and Fayland Lam for reporting the bug and Clinton Gormley 
    ('DRTECH') for advice.
    
2.01
  - Removed debugging line

2.00
    === API CHANGE ===
    The options html_tags, no_html and no_jslink are  no longer supported 
    by the new method. It _will_ break your code. The reason for this is the 
    implementation of scanning the output with HTML::StripScripts::Parser 
    (and the reason for that are the piling XSS-related bug reports ;-)
    ==================

  - Bumped up to version 2.00 due to the API CHANGE.
  - html_tags has been removed
  - no_html has been removed
  - no_jslink has been removed
  - HTML::StripScripts::Parser has been implemented for security reasons
  - Fixed XSS bug (Ticket 28830)
    Thanks to Jürgen Peters ('TAULMARIL') for reporting the bug and 
    helping me fix it (as well as Clinton Gormley ('DRTECH') for offering 
    help with his module!).

1.00
  - This module has basically been built from scratch again, for a lot
    of problems were spotted by various users (THANKS ALL!). The module now
    uses a 'poor man's parser' that will fix nesting problems. Also the
    linebreak options will ignore [code]-blocks.

  Thanx to Ken for pointing these 'flaws' out to me :)
