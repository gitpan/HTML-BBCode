1.00
  - This module has basically been built from scratch again, for a lot
    of problems were spotted by various users (THANKS ALL!). The module now
    uses a 'poor man's parser' that will fix nesting problems. Also the
    linebreak options will ignore [code]-blocks.

  - 'no_html' option, for "stripping" HTML input
  - 'linebreaks' option, for inserting '<br />' tags

  Thanx to Ken for pointing these 'flaws' out to me :)
